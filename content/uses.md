Here's some of the stuff I use for work and procrastination.

## Dev and Networking Hardware
- **MacBook Air (M1)** - A big Mac for making shiny squares look extra crispy.
- **[HHKB Pro 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K9QHF4P)** - I got the all-black keys and it took me a while to get used to the new layout without being able to tell which key is which. Worth every penny, though.
- **[Logitech MX Ergo](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.html)** - So nice and comfortable.
- **[beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro](https://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/dt-990-pro.html)** - These are overkill for essentially Zoom and podcasts. But TOOL does sound lovely in lossless.
- **[Schiit Modi](https://www.schiit.com/products/modi-1)** - Solid DAC for my listening needs.
- **[Schiit Magni](https://www.schiit.com/products/magni-1)** - Solid Amp to power the DT 990 Pros.
- **[UpDesk Standing Desk](https://updesk.com/products/updesk-electric-lift-standing-desk-upwrite-midnight-black-top-on-black-frame-closeout)** - The table is pretty good, but the customer service is literally nonexistent.
- **[Secretlab Omega Chair](https://secretlab.co/collections/omega-series)** - Great chair.
- **[Tripp Lite 1500VA 900W UPS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009TZTGWK/)** - I believe I heard about the brand from Marco Arment. Solid UPS.
- **iPhone 12 Mini** - This is a perfect size. Fight me.
- **AirPods Pro** - Got the [Ticci mod](https://www.macstories.net/stories/how-i-modded-the-silicone-tips-of-airpods-pro-with-a-memory-foam-layer/).
- **[Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-unifi-os-consoles/products/udm-pro)** - The only reason I got the Pro was to mount it on a rack.
- **[Ubiquiti Switch 8 (PoE)](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-switching/products/unifi-switch-8-60w)** - I have a couple of these around the house to extend the ports coming out the wall.
- **[Ubiquiti UniFi AC Pro](https://store.ui.com/collections/wireless/products/unifi-ac-pro)** - Solid access point.
- **[Ubiquiti Access Point In-Wall HD](https://store.ui.com/products/unifi-in-wall-hd)** - Another solid access point. Running in mesh with the other AP.
- **Raspberry Pi ([PiHole](https://pi-hole.net))** - This is the best decision I've made for my home network.

## Audio Gear
- **[Bluesound NODE](https://www.bluesound.com/products/node/)** - This serves as audio input for the TV as well as an AirPlay and Roon endpoint. Pretty sweet.
- **[Schiit Modius](https://www.schiit.com/products/modius)** - This takes the SPDIF digital signal from the NODE.
- **[Schiit Aegir](https://www.schiit.com/products/aegir)** - Then two of these (monoblock) take the balanced signal from the Modius.
- **[Klipsch RP-600M](https://www.klipsch.com/products/rp-600m-bookshelf-speakers)** - These sounds great and sweet for my messed up hearing.

## Mac Software
[Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com) all the things.

- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)** - Honestly, I've tried all the editors at this point. This is by far the most decent one. It is solid enough, way too customizable, and integrates perfectly with all my tooling.
- **[iTerm](https://iterm2.com)** - Best macOS terminal.
- **[Blink](https://www.blink.sh)** - Best iOS terminal.
- **[Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com)** - I can't believe this is an iOS app; paramount for mobile Git-ing.
- **[Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/)** - Rarely use it, but it's nice to look at.
- **[ShellFish](https://secureshellfish.app)** - _The_ iOS FTP app.
- **[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/)** - Who needs Photoshop.
- **[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)** - I've tried them all and this UI is simply the best for me.
- **[Drafts](https://getdrafts.com)** - All text starts here.
- **[Jayson](https://jayson.app)** - Nice UI for JSON on iOS.
- **[Scriptable](https://scriptable.app)** - Some times you _just_ need a little JavaScript.
- **[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)** - Spotlight is great and Launchbar looks nicer, but you just can't compare to the power of Alfred.
- **[Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/)** - A computer should run itself. This does the trick.
- **[Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/)** - Nifty little window manager.
- **[Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/)** - Too much crap on the menu bar.

## Daily Apps
- **[Castro](https://castro.fm)** - I always go back and forth between this and [Overcast](https://overcast.fm). I love Overcast for its quality build, but Castro has a fantastic UI.
- **[Reeder](https://reederapp.com)** - I've been using the iOS sync feature and works perfectly.
- **[GoodLinks](https://goodlinks.app)** - This is honestly the best read-it-later app you can find. It's pretty much perfect.
- **[Apollo](https://apolloapp.io)** -  The _only_ Reddit app.
- **[Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/)** - You're an animal if you use the official Twitter app.

There are obviously several more hardware and software I use. But these are the main things I cannot live without daily.

For an even nerdier list, take a look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/fourjuaneight/dotfiles) and see into the soul of my Mac.
