Hi, I like websites, and I'm [Juan Villela](https://www.juanvillela.dev/). Most of my time is spent making them for others online. When I'm not working, I hoard digital media for my weird pet project.

Writing isn't my strong suit. But I do it from time to time. It's therapeutic and helps me clear my head. I write about exciting things in this blog and some of my coding projects. I'm not sure what else to say, so here's a list of "fun facts" about me I guess:

- I like stickers. Almost every electronic I own is covered in stickers.
- I build mechanical keyboards now and then.
- I love cooking. I like to think I'm pretty decent at it.
- I like RPGs. Primarily those out of Japan. Like the 200-hour-long, convoluted storyline, with 30 characters type of RPGs.
- I ~~collect~~ hoard [Magic: The Gathering](/mtg/) cards kept in an excellent binder I rarely open. Of course, I also record which cards I own on a database and render them on a nice UI on this site.
- I like making lists.
- I delivered a baby once. It was not magical for me, the staff on the ambulance, or the person giving birth. It's the most stressful I've ever been in my life.

## Work
I work as a senior full-stack web developer full-time from home. These days, I mostly make Angular and React enterprise apps. And some REST and GraphQL APIs. But here's an excellent list of skills:
