Hi, I'm Juan and I like websites. Most of my time is spent making them for strangers online. When I'm not working, I'm probably still coding.

## Work
I currently work as a "Full-Stack" Web Developer over at [Big Pixel](https://thebigpixel.net/). These days I mostly work with Angular and React. And some REST and GraphQL APIs. Here's a cool list of skills:

### Stack:
JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, SCSS, HTML

### Frameworks:
Angular, React, Gatsby, Next, Hugo, Eleventy, Jekyll, NestJS, Express, GraphQL

### Tooling:
Node, Redux (Redux Toolkit), Webpack, Gulp, Jest, Cypress, aXe, TravisCI, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, Gitlab/Bitbucket Pipeline

### Design Tools:
Figma, Sketch, InVision, Photoshop, Affinity Designer

### Other Skills:
Nunchuck, Bo Hunting, Computer Hacking

## Personal
I don't know, here's another list:

- I like stickers.
- From time to time I build mechanical keyboards.
- I'm a cheap audiophile. Meaning, I refuse to pay more than a grand for a single piece of gear.
- In a never-ending attempt to keep a decent archive of bookmarks that are independent of service and resistant to link rot, I maintain a small army of scripts to archive everything I find interesting on the web. Take a look [here](https://github.com/fourjuaneight/archiver) for more on the archiving part and [here](https://github.com/fourjuaneight/scriptable) for the scripts that help me accomplish this on my phone.
- I really like cooking.
- RSS over Twitter. Podcasts over anything.
- I still haven't decided if I want to pay to stream all media or store everything on a home server and stream my media. So I have both.
