Hi, I'm [Juan Villela](https://www.juanvillela.dev/) and I like websites. Most of my time is spent making them for others online. When I'm not working, I'm probably still coding.

Writing isn't my strong suit. But I do it ~~quite often~~ from time to time. It's therapeutic and helps me clear my head. In this blog, I write about notable things I find interesting and some of my coding projects. I'm not sure what else to say so here's a list of "fun facts" about me, I guess:

- I like stickers. Almost every electronic I own is covered in stickers.
- From time to time I build mechanical keyboards.
- I love cooking. It relieves my stress, makes me happy, and feel an immense sense of accomplishment almost immediately.
- I like JRPGs. Like the 200-hour-long, convoluted storyline, with 30 characters type of JRPGs.
- I ~~collect~~ hoard Magic The Gathering cards, which are kept in a cool binder I almost never open. For some reason, I also keep a record of which cards I own on a database and render it on a nice UI on this site. You can check it out on the [MTG](/mtg/) page.
- I really like making lists. It's a concise, well-structured, and simple method of conveying your thoughts for others to understand.
- I delivered a baby once. It was not magical for me, the staff on the ambulance, or the person giving birth. It's the most stressful I've ever been in my life.
