Hi, I'm [Juan](https://www.juanvillela.dev/) and I like websites. Most of my time is spent making them for others online. When I'm not working, I play video games and hoard digital media for my weird pet project.

Writing isn't my strong suit. But I do it from time to time. It's therapeutic and helps me clear my head. I write about interesting things I find online and some of my coding projects. I'm not sure what else to say, so here's a list of "fun facts" about me:

- I like stickers. Most of my office is covered in stickers.
- I build mechanical keyboards every now and then.
- I love cooking. I like to think I'm pretty decent at it.
- I like RPGs. Primarily those out of Japan. Like the 200-hour-long, convoluted storyline, with 30 characters type of RPGs.
- I ~~collect~~ hoard Magic: The Gathering cards and keep them in a cool binder I rarely open.
- I like making lists.
- I delivered a baby once. It was not magical for me, the staff on the ambulance, or the person giving birth. It's the most stressed I've ever been in my life.

## Work
I work as a software engineer in health tech. That's it. I don't know what else you wanna know. But, if you're really interested, check out my [online resume](https://resume.juanvillela.dev).
