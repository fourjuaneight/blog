Hi, I'm [Juan Villela](https://www.juanvillela.dev/) and I like websites. Most of my time is spent making them for strangers online. When I'm not working, I'm probably still coding.

Writing isn't my strong suit. But I do it quite often. It's therapeutic and helps me clear my head. In this blog, I write notable things of interest and some of my coding projects. I'm not sure what else to say so here's a list:

- I like stickers.
- From time to time I build mechanical keyboards.
- I'm somewhat into audio gear.
- I really like cooking.
- I'm big into JRPGs, but mostly the older stuff.
- I ~~collect~~ hoard Magic The Gathering cards.
- I really like making lists.
- I delivered a baby once.

## Work

I currently work as a Senior Full-Stack Web Developer over at [Big Pixel](https://thebigpixel.net/). These days I mostly make Angular and React enterprise apps. And some REST and GraphQL APIs. But here's a cool list of skills:
