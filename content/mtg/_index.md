A digital library of my personal Magic collection. I mostly collect the creepiest cards I come across. Or anything of note that [Rhystic Studies](https://www.youtube.com/c/RhysticStudies) talks about.

All data is sourced from [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com) with the help of a [Cloudflare Worker](https://github.com/fourjuaneight/mtg).
