A simple digital bookshelf of my favorite media. This isn't everything I've consumed. But rather, just the stuff that I enjoyed the most and would watch/read/play again. Anything with a little mark on the top right means it's currently being watched/read/played. You can click on the star rating to see a brief commentary.

For more info on the inspiration behind this, checkout my post [On Owning Your Data](/posts/on-owning-your-data/).

_**Warning:** Ratings, comments, and preference on each and every one of these items are mine alone. If you find anything offensive, well, sounds like a personal problem to me. You're welcome to complain on Twitter (link below)._
