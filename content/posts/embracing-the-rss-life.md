Social media has been consuming way too much of my time. I found myself spending endless hours on those apps, just mindlessly scrolling. What's worse, my RSS feed became just as overwhelming, clogged with too many unread posts I could never get to. So, I think it's time for a change. I need to clean up my RSS feed and refocus on more indie creators, cutting through the noise and getting back to genuine, quality content.

It all started with a simple realization: social media was controlling my life. I started to feel like I didn't have enough free time. Even though my work has been more relaxed and I've had less of it. Social media was just eating up the free time I did have. So it was time for a drastic change. And I went ahead and deleted most social apps from my phone and logged myself out on every browser. I even utilized iOS's Screen Time to slap some restrictions on what little social media I had left. My mission was to regain control over my time and mind.

However, I still wanted to browse the web and keep in touch with what others were up to. So I restructured my feeds on Reeder, a no-nonsense and beautiful RSS client with a Read It Later feature. First, I unsubscribed from a ton of dead sites and others I knew I would never pick back up again. Then, I subscribed to a bunch of indie creators who wrote more personal content. However, this was still not enough. So I opted for a better organizational strategy and sorted my feed into folders. This made it not only easier to parse content but also quickly unsubscribe from anything I lost interest in.

While this solved most of the issues in been having with my time online, I still wanted to keep some sort of way to know what was happening in the world. So I decided to leave Ivory on my phone. Sure, Mastodon still counts as social media, but it's refreshing—no algorithms pushing random stuff at me. I followed the same voices I used to follow on Threads, but here, my feed felt genuinely curated by me.

To keep my reading smooth and fun, I set up some ground rules. If an article didn't grab me right away, it got the boot—no hard feelings. If something caught my eye, I'd save it for later. And the change was incredible. Making the "switch" to RSS didn't just change how I consumed content; it transformed my whole online experience. Every piece of content felt like a thoughtful pick. It wasn't there because an algorithm thought I should see it but because I chose it.

One of the best outcomes was the drop in stress. Without the barrage of alarming news and clickbait, my mind felt clearer and calmer. I wasn't constantly bombarded with outrage and despair, which was a huge relief.

The most noticeable difference, though, was time. No more endless scrolling meant I had hours back in my day. I funneled that time into more rewarding activities and just being present.

And RSS doesn't make me feel isolated—in fact, it does the opposite. I started real conversations with the authors of the blogs I followed, leading to genuine interactions that felt way more substantial than a quick like or repost.

This curated journey led me to new interests, diving into niche areas of technology, stories, and thoughtful discussions. My RSS feeds have become a well of inspiration, pushing me to explore beyond my usual digital comfort zone. If you're also feeling drained by the relentless flow of algorithm-driven content, give RSS a shot. Reclaim your time, your peace, and your curiosity. You might find that in those quiet, curated corners of the internet, there's a much more fulfilling digital experience waiting for you.
