There's something undeniably magical about a well-designed single-purpose app. These gems of the software universe don't try to tackle every problem known to humankind; instead, they laser-focus on doing one thing exceptionally well. And that's precisely why they shine.

## The Risks of Over-Reliance

Matan summed it up perfectly in his post [One-Thing Apps](https://matanabudy.com/one-thing-apps/):

> I don't want what they call a Super-app. I want an app designed to solve something specific, one that has been thoughtfully crafted to address a particular need.

Super-apps, with their endless features and promises of convenience, often result in a chaotic mess. The allure of having everything in one place comes at a hefty price—the risk of putting all your digital eggs in one basket is just too high.

[Juha-Matti Santala](https://hamatti.org/posts/do-one-thing-well-and-communicate-with-others/) points out the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and its first two points:

0. Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".
1. Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter the output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.

## A Case in Point: Things for macOS and iOS

This app–designed by [Cultured Code](https://www.culturedcode.com/)–epitomizes single-purpose excellence by focusing solely on task management and executing it so elegantly that it becomes a genuine source of joy.

The design of the Mac, iPad, and iPhone apps is nothing short of amazing. The UI features vibrant icons, exquisite typography, and masterful use of white space. Despite being finely tuned to each platform, Things maintains a consistent user experience, giving the impression of a unified application. Things offers the same level of control and functionality across all it's apps.

## One Thing is Enough

We don't need sprawling apps that attempt to solve every conceivable issue under one roof. No, we deserve specialized tools that excel at their specific tasks—without shackling us to their ecosystem or drowning us in unnecessary features. I revel in the elegance and efficiency of single-purpose apps and eagerly advocate for more of them in our digital toolkits. By honing in on their core strengths, apps like Things become exemplars of how enriching a single-purpose approach can truly be.
