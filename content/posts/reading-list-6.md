The last few weeks have felt like months. What a wild time. I didn't have much time to catch up on my RSS or Read it Later feeds. But I didn't listen to a lot of podcasts while I worked.

## Notes

My work rarely requires me to seriously concentrate. By that I mean, having to focus so intently that I cannot let external factors interrupt me. Sure, I get the occasional urgent bug that needs my full attention. But more often than not, I'm watching or listening to something while I work. And that's usually a podcast.

One of my favorite podcasts to listen to while I work is [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com). For those of you who don't know it, Jack Rhysider tells some of the wildest stories in the world of cybersecurity. A lot of these are what you'd expect. But some are truly insane. Here are 4 of my absolute favorites. And also some of the craziest I've heard.
