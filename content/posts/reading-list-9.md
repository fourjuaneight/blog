We have been moving for the past month. It has been exhausting. Physically, of course, but also mentally. We bought our first home. Which is something I never thought would happen, but I'm grateful we achieved. That said, it's so much damn work.

So blogging took a backseat during these weeks. And I'm having a hard time getting back into my old routines. So what better way to get back to blogging than with a link dump.

## Notes

Big life changes bring about reflection. I've spent the last month thinking about our lives and how we want to spend them. How we want to be remembered. And what is important to us. And I think we just want to enjoy every single day together. Our company. And do the things we love. If some of what we do brings joy to others, then even better. But I think it's also important to make sure you're happy first and foremost.
