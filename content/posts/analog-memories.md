I've been reminiscing about my childhood recently. More specifically, around the time I was 8. I have some fond memories of those years. And it got me thinking about how we make memories. A deeply ingrained aspect of humanity—this almost primitive urge to capture life's transient moments and give them permanence.

Like most people, I take a lot of pictures with my phone. All of them stored in digital vaults across servers and gadgets, scattered through the nebulous ether of iCloud and Google Photos. They are a cacophony of moments—some mundane, others extraordinary. However, despite the sheer volume of images, I rarely see them. They are stored away and visited occasionally during moments of nostalgia or accidental scrolls.

Recently, though, an Apple TV slideshow transformed my perception. It's slow and deliberate, making old memories resurface with startling clarity. That trip to West Virginia, moving across state lines, that impromptu road trip to the mountains, being locked up for months while the world burned, and so on. Each image captures a fragment of our experiences, coming together in a lovely mosaic that reveals who we are and where we've been. It's been a beautiful way to relive those moments–to let them breathe in our living room.

But something is still missing. Snapping photos with my phone lacks a certain magic, a ritualistic essence. Each image, captured quickly and with little thought, gets lost in the immediacy and convenience. I crave a way to slow down, feel the weight of each memory in my hands, and build something tangible from the digital ether.

I want to order printed books of our photos, turning those thousands of pixels into something heftier, more consequential. My partner recently bought a Fuji Instax, and our home now brims with small albums of instant photos. These little images capture the everyday moments that seem mundane at the time but usually end up being what we remember the most. There's something inherently magical about them, in their imperfect, immediate presence.

This has reignited my desire to capture life through physical photos. With this renewed passion, I boldly ordered a film camera: the venerable Pentax MX. It's a humble, mechanical marvel from an era more connected to touch and technique than to screens and scrolling.

I know nothing about film cameras—but I'm thrilled. The process seems akin to alchemy; an arcane ritual where light and time marry in the emulsion, producing images imbued with the aura of effort and anticipation. This odyssey toward creating poignant, tangible memories feels like reclaiming an intrinsic part of the human experience that digital technology has obscured. Each photograph serves as a testament not only to what we witness but also to how we internalize these moments.
