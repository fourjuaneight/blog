I want to blog again. It's been something I've struggled to do consistently for longer than a few months at a time. Maybe because I don't find much interest in sharing or because social media has made me crave attentionâ€”something that requires more effort with a blog. Maybe I'm just lazy. Either way, as I've gotten older and my relationship with the internet has matured, I've developed a healthier relationship with the online communities I frequent. And I think I'd love to share more of my thoughts.

In part, because social media is dying, and spending time there makes me feel icky. But also, because I've become increasingly concerned with what I'll leave behind for my loved ones after I'm gone. I'd like for them to still feel connected with who I was and a blog is a great medium to convey what my thoughts and interest. Luckily we live in an era with a plethora of options to "immortalize" yourself, even if most of it is built on top of this [delicate infrastructure](/posts/on-internet-access/). Nevertheless, I feel confident the internet and the behemoths that control it will still be around in the next 50 years. So I think it's safe to say this will still be up for a while.

But fear of mortality aside, I believe more of us should [host and own our content](/posts/on-owning-your-data/). I'm not saying put up your wall garden, but rather, make your blog/site/feed your main hub, then syndicate everywhere else. It's the easiest way to ensure your content remains yours and stands the test of billionaires' whims.
