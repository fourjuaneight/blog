I've had a couple of hectic months. But I'm back on track with my routines and have been revisiting some of my favorite articles about fighting for what's important to you. Specifically on the web.

## Notes

I'm a firm believer that you shouldn't trust your data on the internet. A manager at some massive media company can [easily destroy years of data](/posts/the-ephemeral-web/) just to balance a spreadsheet. Or you can find yourself between ISP turf wars and [have terrible internet access](/posts/on-internet-access/).

And that often fills me with some despair. However, reading how some people find ways to preserve the things and relationships they love, does give me hope.

I think the best part about the web is the people. Not those that run the massive walled gardens that make up a lot of it. But the actual people online making content and building communities. And it's that enduring spirit to make it better and more accessible that gives me hope for the future of the web.
