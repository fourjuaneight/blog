I’ve had enough of streaming music services. Between the bloated interfaces and unreliable catalogs, I reached my breaking point. I was a Spotify subscriber from day one. Shortly after Apple Music came out, I moved over because of the better integration. But now, I'm all in on Plex. Despite its quirks and complexities, this transition has been extremely rewarding. And I don't plan on ever leaving.

First, let's address Spotify. The app has turned into a cluttered mess, reminiscent of Instagram's chaotic interface. It simply doesn't know what it wants to be. There was a time when Spotify excelled as a user-friendly music streaming service. But over time, it became bogged down by an overwhelming number of features, diluting the core user experience.

Beyond the clutter, ethical concerns also played a role. Spotify’s push for increased user engagement often compromises fair artist compensation. The paltry payouts per stream and recent unfavorable policies for low-stream songs made me realize it was time for a change.

Then, I turned to Apple Music, hopeful that its reputation for quality would deliver a better experience. Unfortunately, it didn’t. I frequently noticed that songs would mysteriously disappear from my library, eroding my trust. The experience on Mac was equally disappointing, with a sluggish interface that was a chore to navigate. And the mobile app has a myriad of playback issues.

Disillusioned, I decided to go back to buying music outright. Platforms like [Qobuz](https://www.qobuz.com/us-en/shop) have a large enough catalog for me to find most things. And for the hard-to-find Japanese tracks, [Ototoy](https://ototoy.jp/top/)[^1] has my back. Most of my files are in FLAC at CD quality, and anyone who tries to convince me that the $3 Hi-Res songs are noticeably better is probably selling snake oil[^2]. CD quality is good enough for almost everyone.

That said, owning music files brings their own set of challenges. For one, storing and organizing them can be a bit cumbersome. That’s where an app like [Meta](https://www.nightbirdsevolve.com/meta/)[^3] comes in handy. I use it to lightly clean up metadata, ensuring that everything is named and categorized correctly. My organizational scheme is straightforward: `ARTIST/ALBUM/SONG.flac`. This hierarchy makes it easy to find whatever I want quickly. Once the files are all sorted out, [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) takes care of the rest.

Initially, I used [Prism](https://prism-music.app) on iOS and Mac for its clean UI and responsive performance. However, I recently switched to [Plexamp](https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/). The app not only offers solid performance and a beautiful interface but also features that elevate it beyond a mere music player. And let’s not forget the listening experience itself. It’s significantly better since I upgraded to a decent pair of [wired headphones](https://www.fiio.com/fd5) and a [mobile amp](https://www.thx.com/thx-onyx/). The investment has been worth it. The sound is richer, more vibrant, and just overall more satisfying.

Admittedly, this setup is far from convenient. Adding new music involves a multi-step process: purchase, download, cleanup, and organization. Moreover, this approach has proven more expensive than subscription services.
But I wouldn’t have it any other way. The extra steps make the music feel authentically mine. No DRM, no rental conditions—just true ownership. Interestingly, the way I discover new music has become more organic. Without algorithms to guide me, I rely on jotting down songs I hear casually or asking friends for recommendations. This method feels more personal and aligned with my tastes.

These days, convenience often overrides quality. And owning my music has rekindled my passion for it. The extra effort is unquestionably worth it.
