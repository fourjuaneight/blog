Over the last few years, Apple has been navigating a precarious tightrope with macOS. Striking a balance between robust security measures and unbridled functionality has long defined the Mac experience. Historically, the Mac has been regarded as a power tool; a sanctuary for creators and power users. Yet, with the increasing stringency of security protocols, many of us find ourselves at odds with an evolving ecosystem that seems more intent on restricting than enabling.

Let's look back to the early days of the classic Mac OS. In those times, the concept of software "privileges" was practically non-existent. If you installed an app, it had free reign. Sure, this laissez-faire approach had risks—a buggy disk utility could result in a complete data wipe. Nevertheless, this openness was cherished.

Fast forward to the present day and modern macOS has made a hard pivot towards safeguarding users, particularly those less technically inclined. [Apps now require explicit permissions to access the camera, microphone, and file system](https://youtu.be/FxOIebkmrqs). Cryptographic signing and Apple notarization have become standard expectations. While this fortified security wall undoubtedly enhances user safety, [it also introduces significant friction for those who prize a more frictionless experience](https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/08/apples-permissions-features-are-out-of-balance/).

## Increasing Frustrations

This paradigm shift in security has its roots in a logical desire to protect users from the growing threat of malware and scams. However, it crosses a line from being a "reasonable balance" to becoming an "infuriating constraint." MacOS now frequently prompts users with permission requests, often for actions they've previously approved. Delving deep into System Settings to adjust these permissions has become an unwelcome part of the user experience.

These safety measures are now getting in the way of doing the job efficiently. Forcing power users to jump through hoops to override settings that should be more seamlessly integrated into their workflow.

## Market vs. Developer Priorities

Broadening our focus on Mac-specific issues, there exists a growing consensus among software developers that modern applications are becoming increasingly bloated, slower, and less reliable. Nikita Prokopov's **[Software Disenchantment](https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/)** and Maciej Cegłowski's **[The Website Obesity Crisis](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm)** underscore this point. Both argue persuasively that, in an age of powerful hardware, applications should be faster, smaller, and more robust. However, they lament that software has grown unwieldy and inefficient.

A pivotal reason for this bloat is the market-driven focus on features over performance and reliability. Software is marketed and sold based on a list of features, with speed and reliability rarely emphasized in promotional materials. Companies are often compelled to delay necessary optimizations, creating an environment where bloated apps with subpar performance become the norm. Users seldom demand leaner, faster apps; instead, they clamor for more functionalities, perpetuating this cycle of ever-expanding software.

Further complicating the issue is the role of the developer within this ecosystem. Despite having substantial leverage—due to their technical expertise and the general scarcity of good developers—the incentives often aren't aligned with creating lean, efficient software. Developers can push back and prioritize technical debt, but this usually comes at professional risk, including resistance from management and misalignment with market priorities.

## A Call for Balance

Reflecting on all this, I can't help but resonate with the idea that modern software has veered off course. Many applications today are overloaded with unnecessary features, acting almost like malware by invading user privacy with excessive permissions to mine data for ads and tracking purposes. Apple's attempt to mitigate these issues through stricter security measures is understandable, but their execution has been flawed.

MacOS's increasingly restrictive environment has hindered the very users who form its backbone: the creators, developers, and power users. While the iPhone and iOS may be Apple's monetary heavyweights, the Mac remains the birthplace of the software and content developed for these platforms. Apple would do well to remember its roots and maintain the Mac's core identity as a powerful, flexible tool for serious computing.

Navigating these choppy waters requires balance. Apple must find a way to offer robust security without alienating its creative and technical users. This means developing more intuitive, less intrusive security measures and fostering an environment where developers can thrive. It's about creating a balance where user protection does not come at the expense of user experience.

For all its technological wizardry, software must ultimately serve those who use it. By recalibrating priorities and addressing systemic issues, there's hope for a future where macOS, and software in general, can meet the needs of both novices and experts alike, preserving efficiency, speed, and, most importantly, user trust.
