I haven't done much reading this month as I've been taking a lot of time off from work to travel and spend time with my partner. But these are some of my favorite articles I re-read recently on a long flight.

## Notes

I love coming across articles like these where the story isn't your flashy pop culture headline. "Facebook is using goats to fuel their server farms". They aren't, by the way. Instead, you get people having a religious experience visiting the most vital semiconductor factory in history. Or the French having secret underground movie nights. They are fascinating and refreshing, in a way.
