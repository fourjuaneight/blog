I've been thinking a lot about data preservation. My ever-expanding digital collection grows exponentially. While the average person might stream all their media and rely on some online drive for photos, I prefer to keep my stuff stored locally. So what happens when my digital treasure trove is threatened by the impermanence of modern storage solutions? Enter the [M-DISC](https://www.mdisc.com). This technology promises something that deeply resonates with anyone who cherishes their digital memories: longevity. We're talking up to 1,000 years.

## The Purpose and Rationale

Our digital lives are fragile. One moment you have cherished family photos securely saved, and the next, they could be lost to a corrupt hard drive or an overlooked deletion. Many of us rotate through backup solutions and providers over the years, increasing the risk of losing important files.

Take an old family photo, for instance. If it gets corrupted, it might be years before you even realize the mishap, and by then, your backups could be long gone. Even with the best backup intentions, frequently changing providers or solutions often lead to the inadvertent purging of older files. Without meticulously checking every single photo, you risk discarding the only remaining copy. I've lost precious memories exactly this way—things I can never get back.

## So Why M-DISC?

M-DISC (Millennial Disc) claims to offer a reliable solution, asserting a storage lifespan of up to 1,000 years. This longevity is a significant selling point for my archiving mission. There's no way to verify these claims. But at the very least I'm confident it will outlast me. Everything I've read seems to indicate that these discs are quite robust and durable to extreme wear and tear.

DVDs and Blu-ray players remain ubiquitous, and logic suggests they'll be around for quite a while. CDs, which were invented nearly 40 years ago, are still readable today without issues. Betting on the continued existence of drives that can read discs feels like a sound decision.

To further ensure future accessibility, I plan on purchasing an additional M-DISC compatible drive and, if necessary, an entire system specifically for running these drives. For now, disc drives are easily obtainable, but I'm hedging my bets. I'll store an extra drive for use if the day comes when these devices start becoming scarce.

## The Setup

I'm buying a Pioneer Blu-ray writer ([BDR-XD08B](https://a.co/d/1ks1Qbc)) and a stack of 25GB Blu-ray M-DISCs from [Verbatim](https://a.co/d/je8ZJLw). Additionally, I'm looking into a small disc binder. The idea is to store it inside a safe that's water and fireproof.

Burning discs is straightforward with the right software. I'm considering using [Burn](https://burn-osx.sourceforge.io/Pages/English/home.html). It's reliable, free, and has stood the test of time. I'll deliberately avoid fancy software like Nero SecurDisc since their tailored solutions might not be usable in the far-off future when we're still accessing these M-DISCs.

For data integrity, I'll generate SHA-256 checksums via [`shasum`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/shasum). A copy for all files is included on the disc and with the source. This way, I can quickly verify the files' integrity and detect any corruption.

## Cost Considerations

Cost is a critical factor. M-DISCs are not cheap compared to regular optical discs. However, for anyone who values their digital memories and data, the investment feels justified. The price of an M-DISC might be higher now, but what is the cost of potentially losing irreplaceable data? Priceless.

Moreover, the additional hardware—whether adapters, drives, or cases—adds to the final cost. However, these expenses are one-time investments when balanced against the assurance of long-term data security.

## Practically Speaking

Nothing about this process screams convenience. Burning discs is labor-intensive, organizing and labeling them takes time, and securely storing them is another challenge. But I'm investing in my peace of mind. Knowing that my data has a shelf life of centuries, barring physical destruction, is a rare gift in our digital age.

As for an organizational strategy, I haven't settled on an approach yet. I have a combination of data files, ebooks, audio, video, ROMs, etc. Everything is categorized by type but not by year. Whichever approach I take, I'll likely maintain a separate database to keep track of relevant metadata.

## Final Thoughts

In the grand scheme, M-DISC provides a unique and valuable solution for long-term data preservation. The initial cost and effort involved in setting up and maintaining an M-DISC archive are outweighed by the security of knowing that your important data is safe for hundreds of years.

While the M-DISC approach is not without its drawbacks, it is currently one of the best options available for those who prioritize the longevity of their digital assets. For archiving treasured family photos and critical documents, the reassurance M-DISC offers is worth every penny and every minute invested.
