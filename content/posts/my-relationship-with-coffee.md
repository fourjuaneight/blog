My relationship with coffee has evolved quite a bit, mirroring the changes I've undergone in my adult life.

Growing up, I was surrounded by coffee lovers. In Latin America, coffee is pretty much a national pastime. My family made it a core part of their daily routine, starting every morning with a cup—or two. For the elders, it extended into evening sessions. It's also how I won over my father-in-law. He's a tough guy, hard-nosed, but we bonded over our love for a good brew.

As an adult, I dabbled in all kinds of coffee-making methods. I started with a Chemex, switched to an Aeropress[^1], and eventually upgraded to an espresso machine. That machine became my pride and joy. I loved the complexity and spent countless hours fine-tuning my process to craft that perfect cup. The routine became my daily meditation.

But after a few years[^2], the grind began to wear on me. I got a little burned out and tired of all the effort. So I made a controversial choice—I sold the espresso machine and caved to a Nespresso. It felt like I was selling my soul, but it was Good Enough™ and wonderfully convenient.

Fast forward a year, and boy, do I regret selling that Breville. I miss the mindful routine it offered. But this past year has stirred some changes in me. I've developed a fondness for older tech and physical media—a rebellion against today's consumerism and tech overload, perhaps.

This shift led me to a local Middle Eastern coffee shop that won me over. They emphasize experience and culture. And that's when I tasted my first Turkish coffee. Watching the barista work their magic was mesmerizing, and the coffee was downright delicious.

Inspired, I splurged on a top-notch manual coffee grinder and dusted off my old Chemex. The Aeropress made a comeback, and I even acquired a cezve to try my hand at making Turkish coffee at home. I'm still perfecting that one, but it's a fun challenge. I took things up a notch by canceling my coffee bean subscriptions and sourcing from a local roaster instead. Now. I drive a few minutes each month to grab a fresh bag.

Sure, it requires more effort. I have to carve out time each day just for coffee, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. It forces me to slow down and sparks all the right kind of satisfaction in my brain. It's a routine that feels satisfying and whole.
