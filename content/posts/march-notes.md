What a month. I hope everyone is staying safe out there. Most of us are spending a lot more time at home than usual. My partner has been at home with me for about three weeks now. And she's starting to crack. I've seen her reorganize the house about four times, and I'm positive it looks the same as it initially did. On the other hand, I am used to spending weeks indoors without seeing the light of day. However, being told I can't go out makes things far more stressful.

Either way, we've been looking for new ways to keep ourselves occupied to prevent anxiety from eating us alive. So here are some of the stuff we've gone through this month.

## Coding
Although my partner isn't working, I still am. My work has always been remote, so things have mostly stayed the same. There's a cool project I've been working on with the folks over at Stackbit, which I hope to share soon. Stay tuned.

I've also been working on getting some of my [Spreadsheets](/posts/spreadsheets/) out in public. An early version of my bookmarks is already up; there's more to come. Thanks to [Hasura's webhooks](https://hasura.io/event-triggers/), I can automate the deployment of this site with every new bookmark saved to the database. Good stuff.

## Digest
But although I'm working as much as ever, I still have plenty of hours during the day to fill with something.

And we've finally reached the point where we browsed Netlify brainlessly, hoping to find something interesting, but to no avail. And our favorite YouTubers need to make videos faster. So, we've now started watching some questionable stuff. Like all the Tremors movies. Did you know they made five ‽ I don't know why, either.

Also, I finally bought a Nintendo Switch. Two. My partner has been playing Animal Crossing like the rest of the planet, but I wanted to catch up on my long backlog of games. And will likely pick up Zelda BoW in a couple of keeps. So there's plenty to keep me occupied.

### Watched
- [21 Bridges](https://letterboxd.com/film/21-bridges/): As far as cop movies go, this was pretty all right.
- [Take Shelter](https://letterboxd.com/film/take-shelter/): A fantastic take on the onset of mental health. Though the end ruins it for me.
- [Servant](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/servant/umc.cmc.4y25wuby7pck9o6vaubbbk7gb): We were captivated from beginning to end. Great show.

Now for the more exciting stuff:
- [Ghost Rider](https://letterboxd.com/film/ghost-rider/): Did they run out of budget for the flaming skull's dialogue?
- [How It Ends](https://letterboxd.com/film/how-it-ends/): Nothing. Not a single thing—aside from the paranoid neighbor—about what happened. I still have no idea how it ends.
- [Tremors 1-5](https://letterboxd.com/film/tremors/): They just keep coming back. It's almost like they don't want to kill me.
- [Color Out of Space](https://letterboxd.com/film/color-out-of-space/): This was an odd and pointless trip.
- [Jumanji: The Next Level](https://letterboxd.com/film/jumanji-the-next-level/): Why is this movie so long?

### Listened
- [Smarter Phones: Journey to the Palm-Sized Computer](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-4/smarter-phones): Killer episode. Intriguing deep dive into the early days of the Palm and how the smartphone got its start.
- [Spaghettageddon Two: 2 Saucy, 2 Carbious](https://www.themcelroy.family/2020/3/2/21161483/mbmbam-500-spaghettageddon-two-2-saucy-2-carbious): This is top tier entertainment right here. You can't go wrong with the McElroys.

### Read
- [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=GsYtdPc1He&rank=1): We are the product.

### Gamed
- [Inside](https://playdead.com/games/inside/): Play Dead does an outstanding job of letting the story speak for itself.
- [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com): I played the Pico-8 version a while back and have been dying to play this on the Switch. Frustratingly beautiful.
