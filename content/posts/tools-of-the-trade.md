I came across an episode of The Pen Addict, where Brad and Myke were discussing an article from The Financial Times going over Jony Ive's "tools of [the] trade". Of course, there were some obscenely priced items on the list. But it believe anyone would agree that no job can be done well without the right tools, regardless of profession. They benefit productivity and can even affect job satisfaction. In web development, the right tooling can make or brake a product.

So I thought I'd make a small list with some of the more crucial tools I use on my day to day as a web dev and why I picked them. If you'd like a long and dirty list of everything I use, you can visit my Uses page.

## Hardware
Most of these items don't work in isolate; they require additional gear. But I want to focus on the main tool that delivers the benefit, sort of speak.

### [HHKB Pro 2](https://hhkeyboard.us/hhkb/pro-classic)
It all starts here. 90% of my work is done with a keyboard. So it goes without saying that the experience needs to be comfortable and seamless. I don't want to have to think about my keyboard, feel fatigue, or have to deal with compatibility. My employers change my machine often enough that it needs to be plug-n-play. And the HHKB fits all these needs perfectly. The built quality is phenomenal and made to last. The keys feel smooth and cause no fatigue on the hands. And this thing will work with anything. I've plugged it into any OS, tablets, phones, gaming consoles. It just works.

### [Logitech MX Ergo](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.html)
Just like the keyboard, this needs to disappear and do it's job well. But also not cause any strain on the wrist. While there are plenty of ergonomic mice, this one has been the most reliable one. Logitech has a good enough track record that I don't have to worry about it dying any time soon. It's been running strong for a few years now.

### [Electro-Voice RE320](https://products.electrovoice.com/ap/en/re320/)
Although I do everything in my power to minimize the time spent in meetings, I still want to sound my best. Video calls are not as common now with the introduction of Slack Huddles. So I like to ensure my voice is heard clearly when I'm getting my message across. The RE320 is the right balance of quality and affordability.

### [beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro](https://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/dt-990-pro.html)
I love these headphones. You need a decent DAC + AMP to get the most out of them, but they're affordable enough and don't require that much juice to power them. They sound clean, but not too much. So listening to podcasts or music for hours on end is smooth and enjoyable.

## Software
These are mostly centered around VSCode, where I spend almost all of my time working. These tools are meant to extend and enhance my productivity without having to leave the editor unless completely necessary.

### [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org)
Terminal emulators are a dime a dozen. But I want something that's robust and stable. Not a fancy and excessively customizable app. Just a terminal where I can tweak how it looks and that's it. This is just that. You can install it via several package managers and customize it with a single YAML file. And it just never fails.

### [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com)
Launchers aren't as over populated as terminals, but there are a few options aside from macOS' own Spotlight. I've tried them all. Raycast has the best user experience. It's not as customizable as Alfred, but you can easily make it your own and write your own custom scripts that plug into the app's API. It also provides a fantastic clipboard and snippets manager. As well as window manager. I replaced 3 others apps with just this one.

### [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/)
This is a simple one. It gives you granular control over your Mac's audio. Down to the app and the output source. Everyone should install this app. It's just a nice quality of life improvement.
