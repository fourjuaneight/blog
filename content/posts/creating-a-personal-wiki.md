Finding reliable information feels increasingly tricky. The internet, once rich with diverse user-driven content, is getting overwhelmed with AI slop. This information deluge, worsened by search engines prioritizing SEO over substance, calls for a more personal approach to knowledge management—the personal wiki, a handcrafted repository where your curated knowledge remains untainted by digital noise.

Or at least that's the general idea.

## Cognitive Overload

Gone are the golden days when the internet was a bastion of authenticity and niche expertise. What we encounter now is a sea of regurgitated content, often generated by AI that produce material at inhuman speeds—albeit without nuance or reliability. Algorithm-driven platforms like Google now cater to mass market searches, leaving those seeking specific, niche knowledge frustrated.

## Wiki as a Solution

Enter the personal wiki. Your knowledge vault, meticulously cataloged to serve your intellectual needs. It's not just about storing facts—it's about **preserving insights** and creating a web of connections.

1. **Tailored Architecture:** Unlike generic search results, your wiki is designed by you, for you—as intuitive and idiosyncratic as your thought process demands.

2. **Streamlined Retrieval:** Documenting your problem-solving journeys means no more repeated Google searches. Your solutions are preserved in your own words.

3. **Effortless Knowledge Sharing:** A personal wiki allows you to easily share valuable information with colleagues or friends, without the clutter of irrelevant SEO-optimized content.

4. **A Fortress Against Digital Din:** Your wiki becomes an archive of authenticity in a world flooded with content tailored not for enlightenment, but for clicks.

## Getting Your Wiki Off the Ground

Building a personal wiki doesn't require complex setups. Using Hugo, Tailwind CSS, and Pagefind, you can create a stylish, efficient, and searchable documentation site with ease. Here's how to begin:

1. **Build It Fast:** Build the whoe thing in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/); a fast and flexible static site generator. It's easy to setup, run, and deploy just about anywhere.

2. **Embrace Simplicity:** Write content in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files for simplicity and readability. It's portable and allows for seamless integration with other tools if a migration is needed.

3. **Style For Accessibility:** Keep It Simple when it comes to styling. Use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), which offers a utility-first approach, making it easy to customize your site with a clean, minimal aesthetic that enhances readability. The UI should be that of a documentation site. This is allows for a more approachable experience when navigating.

4. **Make It Easy To Find:** Using [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) adds a lightweight search solution. This can work on any site, with any build tool, without the need of heavy JavaScript.

5. **Organize by Sections and Tags:** This is how everything will be tied together. Structure examples:
   - Sections: Programming, Cooking, Finance
   - Tags: `#python`, `#javascript`, `#recipes`, `#budgeting`
   - Cross-reference related content: "See also: [Link to related page]"
   - Group content across sections by taxonomy pages: `/tags/budgeting`

6. **Deploy and Update Regularly:** Free hosting via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) is a great way to set it and forget it. No need to keep manually deploy; they both connect to any repositoy and deploy on every push.

## Alternative Tools

If Hugo seems too technical, consider these alternatives:
- **Obsidian:** A robust knowledge base that works on top of local Markdown files
- **Notion:** User-friendly with databases, templates, and collaboration features
- **TiddlyWiki:** A single HTML file that works offline with no installation needed

## Embracing Intellectual Autonomy

As the web continues to evolve in unexpected ways, establishing a personal knowledge repository gives you solid footing. Your knowledge integrity remains unaffected by the ephemeral whims of the digital landscape. A personal wiki isn't merely a static vault of facts but a living narrative that informs and empowers.

By creating a personal wiki, you stake a claim to a corner of the digital world where trusted knowledge flourishes free from clutter—honoring the original spirit of the internet, where individuality and insight were the actual currency.
