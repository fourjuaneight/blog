This week, in transition jobs. And this is my last week at the company I've worked for the last 3 years. It's a bittersweet moment, but it's time to move on to greater things. But I also had a lot of free time these last few days and I got to catch up on my RSS feed!

## Notes

Working in tech today is a wild ride, to say the least. Every day, there’s some breakthrough that promises to replace us in a couple of years. There are massive layoffs hitting headlines, making job security feel like a thing of the past for many of us. It’s a constant reminder that we’re in a field that’s as uncertain as it is exciting.

On top of that, the push for profits can get intense. Executives are always on the lookout for the next big thing that will send profits soaring, even if it means burning the midnight oil too often. It’s like we’re always racing, trying to keep up with the pace of "innovation".

Working in tech is painful, rewarding, and exhausting...all at the same time.
