I've been neck-deep into my M-Disc archival project this month and haven't done a lot of reading. But yesterday I had a dentist appointment and somehow managed to waste the whole day there. And instead of doomscrolling, I caught up on my Read-It-Later backlog. So here are a few gems I found buried in there.

## Notes

An animal apocalypse, a man notorious book thief, and the governments massive hoard of cheese. This is by far the best list I've put together. And I know this is only #4. But I believe this statement will hold for years to come.
