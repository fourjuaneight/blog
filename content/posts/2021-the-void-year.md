Right around the start of the pandemic, I lost interest in blogging. Well, it could be more straightforward.

I've been working remotely for four years now. So, I became accustomed to what many have had a rough time getting used to recently, a few years ago. I can work several hours while sitting in the same position as a potato and call it a productive day. On the other hand, my partner was always the type to keep constantly busy and work on her feet. So, when she was forced to stay home for a couple of weeks around March 2020, she needed all my support to make the transition bearable.

And we all know how those "couple of weeks" turned into a couple of years. She's still home; she never went back to work. Our lives changed. It did for everyone. But more so than that, we became different people from how we approach plans for the future to the stuff we watch on TV. We are no longer the same, for better or for worse. And so, I stop caring about sharing my thoughts online. Why would I when we were all thinking the same things?

But that recently changed all of a sudden. There are still things I want to share about productivity and automation. But nowhere near with the same zeal, I had a couple of years ago. And that's fine. Like I've already said, I changed. And so did my workflow. But more on that in the future. I want to share my thoughts on this past year. It was a year that practically flew by. A year for which I can hardly recall anything about.

## The Space
I can remember everything that we did throughout 2020. From the first moment I heard about what was happening in Asia, my paranoia exploded, and I began buying masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer. I didn't hoard these items like many others, but I did buy enough that I'm just starting to run out now. Shortly after, my partner was sent home, and we were quickly forced to evaluate how we shared our lives and personal space. We are more vital now than we were before. I'm still working through things, but I'm strong. The rest of the years were a lot more paranoid, with a significant change in my career and a big shift in our living situation. In short, all of these improved. All in all, 2020 was a good year for us despite everything.

But then, the only significant event I can recall from 2021 (aside from the events of January 6th) is us adopting a cat. Everything else is just a blur. I know I worked a lot. We got fatter. We overhauled our whole lives to accommodate a complicated fur ball. I read a massive pile of manga. And that's it? Events blend, and I can't pinpoint anything. There's no linear sequence of events that I can gather to recall the whole year.

We lived and made it through without paying much attention.

## The Empty
But that's why I'm writing this. I want to figure out why this year has felt devoid of substance. And as I write this very sentence, I know why it is. Every day was more or less the same. The news kept getting worse to the point that we stopped listening. What seemed like a light at the end of the tunnel just kept getting pushed further and further away. And any plans we made kept getting rescheduled until we gave up on making any. We stopped paying attention and focused on ensuring our mental health was taken care of. And one way or another, we managed to keep it together. But we ignored everything around us.

And we're not the only ones that feel this way. But worse yet, I think this won't be the only year we'll feel this way. I don't need to say it any more than what has already been constantly screamed in every corner of the Internet. Things are shit and will her shittier. We're doing what we can. But we still need to live. So, we don't pay attention as much to what is almost out of our control and focus on what we can control.

## The Void
So what did we do during 2021? We found time to do what we've wanted for a while now. My partner started writing. A lot happened to her personally, and writing became a way to let out everything, crowding her thoughts. And she has filled volumes with thoughts and ideas. I stopped writing and read moreâ€”everything I wanted to read. Getting lost in other worlds comforted my days and made my dreams more adventurous. I continued cataloging everything I found interesting online and finally finished many projects I had in mind but needed to find the time.

So how is it that the year felt like a void even still? Well, we barely left the house. We only watch the news when it is crucial. And we got lost in our worlds. Everything else was thrown out the window, and we stopped trying to find "the bright side" and embraced the chaos.

That's not the right thing to do. And frankly, I don't care anymore. You may read this and find it helpful, or it might resonate with how you're feeling. I don't know. What I do know is that right now, we're alright. We're mostly happy. And alive. And healthy. And that's enough for us. And I hope that what you're doing is enough to help you through it all.
