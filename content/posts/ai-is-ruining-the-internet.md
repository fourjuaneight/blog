The elusive enchantment of Artificial Intelligence has cast a spell over the tech world and the unsuspecting public alike. We're promised miracles by large language models; that our every informational whim shall be met with unprecedented ease. But beneath this dazzling facade, AI companies are more like unscrupulous puppeteers pulling strings in the shadow, devouring online content in a feeding frenzy. They lie through their teeth about where this data comes from, eroding the ethical bedrock the internet was built on.

## Their Deceptive Exploitation

**[Perplexity Is a Bullshit Machine](https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/)** and **[Perplexity AI Is Lying about Their User Agent](https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/)**—two recent exposés—lay bare the grimy underbelly of Perplexity AI. This startup, which lauds itself as a harbinger of real-time, natural-language answers, is caught red-handed in unethical scraping of content from websites that have barred them via `robots.txt`.

[Federico from MacStories revealed that Perplexity kept plundering their content, even after implementing server-side blocks](https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/112621000120261399). Technical tests showed other user agents obeyed these blocks, while Perplexity seemed to dance around them, likely using headless browsers or masking user agents to slip through unnoticed. Ignoring webmasters' control is more than unethical—it's an appalling affront to the principles of respect and transparency that should govern the web.

## The Fallout for Everyday Internet Users

Companies that lie about their data origins corrode trust not just with the creators but with end-users too. These falsehoods breed misinformation and spew out plagiarized, misleading content. This unpermitted use of web material brazenly violates intellectual property rights, setting the stage for legal battles. As AI's shadow grows larger, so will these clashes, underscoring a crying need for stricter legal norms.

The ripple effect of this exploitation isn't just some abstract concept; it tangibly rots the web experiences of regular users and content creators alike. Websites and small businesses thrive on web traffic and original content to drive ad revenue. By looting online content without a shred of consent, these smaller entities are financially crippled, which erodes the web's diversity and dynamism.

Unchecked, these vile practices of content scraping by AI firms will drive the internet into a bleak wasteland. We could be heading toward a digital dystopia. And even pushing for legislative and tech countermeasures against scraping may create unwelcome barriers, stifling the free spirit of innovation and open access. Gigantic AI enterprises might seize control of valuable data, cornering the market and smothering smaller players in the process.

## Searching for Solutions in a Desolate Landscape

Sure, there are supposed solutions, but let's not kid ourselves—each comes with its own set of grim limitations:

1. **Stricter Regulations**: Governments could roll out tougher data protection laws, mandating transparency and explicit consent for scraping. Yet laws are often sluggish beasts, forever lagging behind the agile and ever-evolving AI tech.

2. **Tech Defenses**: Content creators and developers could deploy advanced bot detectors, CAPTCHAs, and other barriers. But these defenses could be mere speed bumps for the sophisticated scraping machines. Not to mention detrimental to the user experience.

3. **Ethical AI Development**: AI firms could, in an ideal world, adopt a code of ethics, respecting the sanctity of creator rules. However, expecting this in a fiercely competitive market might be nothing more than a delusion.

4. **De-Indexing**: We could also just block all crawlers and indexers and simply depend on word of mouth like in the early days of the internet. But in the vast oceans of the open web, this is like swimming into the open ocean alone hoping for the best.
  
The cold, hard truth is that the speed of AI progression and the sprawling nature of the internet make these solutions feel like drops in an ocean. Unless there's a seismic shift in how both regulators and industry stakeholders approach this issue, our dystopian digital future might just become our reality.
