The digital landscape is vast and chaotic, with moments of brilliance often lost in obscurity. As we collect bookmarks, we quickly recognize that many online artifacts have vanished. Links break, content evaporates—so, [is stuff online worth saving?](https://rubenerd.com/is-it-worth-saving/)

Ruben encountered this question while conversing with a colleague about [self-hosting his bookmarks](https://rubenerd.com/bookmarking-services/). And it's something I ask myself quite often as well.

It's disheartening to find a once-pivotal article reduced to an error page, leaving a feeling of defeat. But we can shift to a creation-focused mindset. Instead of treating the web as a fleeting playground filled with skims and scrolls, we can evolve from passive consumption to active curation. Transforming your bookmarks into a carefully curated archive reflecting your digital journey.

Rather than lamenting lost links, I prefer to concentrate on the insights and dialogues they inspired. Platforms will change and disappear, but we can weave these fading fragments into something meaningful.

Valuing our experiences and memories informs the saving of digital content. This shift highlights what we consider worthy of preservation; even ephemeral material can spark deeper reflections and connections. While broken links and disappearing content plague the web, we can create a sanctuary for our thoughts, bookmarks, and reflections.

So, is anything online worth saving? Absolutely—especially when it brings joy, imparts knowledge, or inspires meaningful dialogue. Even when a link is broken, sharing it contributes to our ongoing quest for understanding and connection.
