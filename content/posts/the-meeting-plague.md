As a software engineer, I've come to accept a harsh reality of modern work life: meetings are everywhere. And not just any meetings; we're talking about an avalanche of pointless discussions that seem to multiply like rabbits. It's almost comical how we've managed to turn what should be productive collaboration into a seemingly unending cycle of interruptions.

Look, I get it. Communication is key. We need to stay aligned, especially in a fast-paced field like tech. But somewhere along the line, we crossed a line from necessary collaboration into meeting overload. It's as if every manager believes that gathering everyone in a virtual room for an hour is the only way to progress, completely ignoring that we all have actual work.

## Meetings Destroy Focus

Studies have been done to show that too many meetings lead to [stress](https://docs.iza.org/dp14336.pdf) and [burnout](https://www.interruptions.net/literature/Luong-GDTRP05.pdf). Each time I'm pulled away from my code to sit through yet another discussion, I can feel my brain unravel. The constant switching between high-focus tasks and shallow discussions not only kills my momentum but also erodes my [productivity](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2021/01/CHI2021_RemoteMeetingMultitask_CameraReady-2.pdf). It takes significant time to get back into the zone after being yanked out of it.

The absurdity lies in the widely held belief that more meetings equals better communication. I can't help but roll my eyes. As highlighted by the folks at Harvard Business Review, this couldn't be farther from the truth. Instead of meaningful collaboration, we're left with a melange of pointless updates and tangents that lead us nowhere. It's frustrating, and it's downright exhausting.

And that's not even taking into account the impact on the team. When your calendar looks like a game of Tetris with back-to-back meetings, morale inevitably drops. Instead of feeling charged and engaged, we're grinding through yet another mind-numbing session that could have just been an email. When did we start honoring the meeting over the actual project work? It feels like an epidemic.

This is too much. Each meeting should have a clear purpose, and if it doesn't, we need to start asking the tough questions. Do we really need to gather just to repeat what's already in a Jira ticket? Can't a quick message on Teams do the trick? The time we waste could be spent in a much more productive way.

## Embrace Asynchronous Communication

What we need is a shift in perspective. Let's embrace asynchronous communication as a solution. Picture a work environment where updates flow freely without the shackles of a meeting timer. We can brainstorm, share ideas, and collaborate without pulling everyone away from their crucial tasks. It's not just a nice idea; it's a sensible way to operate, especially in a field where deep concentration is paramount.

This is not just about cutting down on the number of meetings; it's about valuing our time and focusing on what truly matters. We all want to get work done. We should create a culture that encourages deep work and authentic collaboration without the constant noise of irrelevant discussions.
